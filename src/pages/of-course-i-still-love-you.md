Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) is the east coast autonomous spaceport droneship (ASDS) that is operated out of Port Canaveral, Florida. The droneship is a modified barge outfitted with a large landing platform, station-keeping thrusters and other equipment to allow SpaceX to land boosters at sea on high-velocity missions that cannot carry enough fuel to allow for a return-to-launch-site landing.
